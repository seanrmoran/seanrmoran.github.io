<h2> The Ownership Graph: Introduction</h2>
<h3>February 7, 2017</h3>


<p><em>My original post </em><a href="https://carta.com/blog/the-ownership-graph-introduction/"><em>here on Carta's blog</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Note that the logos on slides say eShares because it was originally published when the company was called eShares, before the </em><a href="https://carta.com/blog/eshares-is-now-carta/"><em>name change</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Let’s say you start a company called Meetly. You hire employees and raise money from investors. A few years in, Meetly’s ownership might look like this:</p>

<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal" style="max-width:700px"><div><img src="The Ownership Graph/1.jpeg" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at investor Krakatoa Ventures.</p>

<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal" style="max-width:700px"><div><img src="The Ownership Graph/2.jpeg" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>Krakatoa Ventures is the name of the venture capital firm, but the firm isn’t a legal entity. The entity that owns 20% of Meetly is called a fund.</p>

<p>Krakatoa Ventures Fund VII, L.P. owns 20% of Meetly. It also owns pieces of other companies:</p>

<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal" style="max-width:700px"><div><img src="The Ownership Graph/4.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>Funds are pooled investment vehicles, meaning multiple parties invest together as one group.</p><p>It can be better to invest as a group versus individually. Together, you can buy more ownership, more information, and more influence.</p>

<p>Investors back venture capital funds for those reasons but also because the fund manager has expertise, access, and time that fund investors may not have.</p>

<p>So who owns the fund?</p>

<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal" style="max-width:700px"><div><img src="The Ownership Graph/5.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>The fund is owned by its partners. General partners (GPs) run day-to-day operations and have personal liability for the fund. Limited partners (LPs) are more passive participants in the fund. Their participation is typically limited to their capital commitment.</p
<p>In many funds, the GPs only provide 1% of the capital and the LPs provide 99%.</p>

<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal" style="max-width:700px"><div><img src="The Ownership Graph/6.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>LPs can be divided into two groups: individuals and institutions.</p>
<p>High net worth individuals invest in funds. These often are friends and family of the GPs or technology executives reinvesting their wealth into a new generation of companies.</p>
<p>The LPs that typically invest the most in a fund are institutional investors. These are entities that own part of the fund on behalf of an organization.</p>

<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal" style="max-width:700px"><div><img src="The Ownership Graph/7.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>Some examples of major types of institutional investors include:</p><ul><li><strong>Endowment</strong> – Harvard University, University of California</li><li><strong>Public Pension</strong> – Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, California Public Employees’ Retirement System</li><li><strong>Insurance</strong> – MetLife, Allianz Capital Partners</li><li><strong>Corporate</strong> – Boeing, IBM</li><li><strong>Sovereign Wealth</strong> – Australia Future Fund, Government of Singapore Investment Corporation</li><li><strong>Fund of Funds</strong> – AlpInvest Partners, Hamilton Lane</li></ul>

<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal" style="max-width:700px"><div><img src="The Ownership Graph/8.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>So Meetly’s ownership is much more stratified than it may seem.</p>
<p>It may not even end there. The entity that invested in Krakatoa’s fund may also be a fund.</p>
<p>At Carta, we help track ownership in both directions – managing your shareholder base or managing your investments.</p>

<p>Facebook built the social graph. This helped enable new behavior that couldn’t exist without the friend layer of the internet.</p>
<p>At Carta, we’re building the ownership graph for private assets. This will help enable new commerce that isn’t possible today.</p>
