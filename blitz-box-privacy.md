## Overview

Blitz Box is made by the Moran Family in Sonoma County, California. We built this game for our family and yours. We respect your privacy and collect as little data as possible.

## What We Collect

**If you opt in to analytics**, we collect anonymous gameplay data to help us balance the game. This includes:

- Dice rolls, tile choices, and card picks
- Game outcomes (win/bust) and scores
- Game mode and duration
- A random device identifier (not linked to your Apple ID, name, email, or any personal information)
- App version

Analytics is **opt-in only**. You are asked on first launch and can change your choice anytime in Settings. If you decline, no gameplay data leaves your device.

## What We Don't Collect

- No names, email addresses, or contact information
- No location data
- No advertising identifiers or tracking pixels
- No third-party analytics SDKs

Your player name (used for the local leaderboard) is stored only on your device and is never transmitted.

## How We Use the Data

Gameplay data is used exclusively to understand how the game is played so we can improve balance and design. We do not sell, share, or transfer this data to third parties.

## Data Storage

Analytics data is stored on servers provided by [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (hosted on AWS). Data is transmitted over HTTPS. Games played offline are queued locally and submitted when connectivity is restored. Data is retained indefinitely for game-balancing analysis. Because the data contains no personal information, it cannot be used to identify you.

## Children's Privacy

Blitz Box is a family game suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Analytics data, when opted in, is fully anonymous and contains no personal identifiers.

## Data Deletion

You can turn off analytics at any time in Settings to stop future data collection. To request deletion of previously collected anonymous data, contact us at [blitzboxgame@gmail.com](mailto:blitzboxgame@gmail.com) with the subject "Data Deletion Request" and we will remove records associated with your device identifier.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this policy, the revised version will be available in the app and at this page. We will update the effective date at the top.
