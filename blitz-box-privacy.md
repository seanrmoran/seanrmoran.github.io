## Overview

Blitz Box is made by a family in Sonoma County, California. We believe in transparency and respect your privacy. This policy explains what data Blitz Box collects, how it is used, and your choices.

## Analytics (Opt-In Only)

Blitz Box includes an optional, opt-in analytics system. On first launch, the app asks if you would like to share anonymous gameplay data to help us balance the game. You can say no, and the app works exactly the same either way. You can change this choice at any time in Settings.

If you opt in, we collect:

- **Gameplay data:** dice rolls, tile choices, card picks, game outcomes, mode played, and game duration
- **A random device identifier:** generated locally on your device, not tied to your name, Apple ID, or any personal information

We do **not** collect:

- Your name, email, or contact information
- Your location
- Your Apple ID or any account identifiers
- Photos, contacts, or any other personal data

## How We Use the Data

Gameplay data is used exclusively to understand how the game is played so we can improve balance and design. We do not sell, share, or transfer this data to third parties.

## Data Storage

Analytics data is stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL database. Data is transmitted over HTTPS. Games played offline are queued locally and submitted when connectivity is restored.

## Children's Privacy

Blitz Box does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The optional analytics system collects only anonymous gameplay data and does not identify individual users.

## Third-Party Services

Blitz Box does not include any third-party advertising, tracking, or analytics SDKs. The only external service is our own Supabase database for opt-in gameplay telemetry.

## Your Choices

- **Opt out of analytics** at any time in Settings
- **Delete your data** by contacting us at the email below

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this policy, we will update the date at the top of this page.
