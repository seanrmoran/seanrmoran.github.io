## Professional

I spent nearly a decade at [Carta](https://carta.com) (formerly eShares), joining in 2015 to start the Investor Services team. I helped build the company from Series A through its growth to become the leading cap table and equity management platform for private companies. During my time there, I focused on building products that help investors manage their portfolios and helped articulate the vision of the "ownership graph" for private assets.

Before Carta, I worked on the product team at Circle Internet Financial and spent three years at Lightspeed Venture Partners, where I moved from financial analysis to the deal team as an associate. I started my career at Ernst & Young.

I'm a graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where I participated in the Semester in San Francisco program.

## Investing

I invest in and advise founders at the earliest stages, with a focus on fintech, developer tools, and companies building infrastructure for the startup ecosystem. Some of my investments include Protocol Labs, On Deck, Allocate, Passthrough, and Banana.

I was an early participant in crypto, first buying Bitcoin in March 2013 and Ethereum in the presale in August 2014.

## Personal

I grew up in Southern California and still have deep ties to punk rock, hardcore, and the music scene that shaped my teenage years. Thrice remains my favorite band. I'm a devoted dad to three kids and I've written about the lessons I've learned along the way.
