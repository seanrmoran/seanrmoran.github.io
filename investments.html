<h2> Investments</h2>
<p>
Growing up, the first time I ever had any real money was from a gift from my grandparents, and I invested it all in Microsoft stock. I remember memorizing my dad’s social security number for Schwab’s phone line to check the daily balance. I bought at 84 1/8 (still fractions then!), and then it split twice and I sold at 120. I was hooked!</p>

<p>
My professional investing career started at Lightspeed. While there, I got to help in a junior role as we invested in companies like Snapchat, Stitch Fix, and GrubHub. After leaving in 2013, I started to dabble in personal investing. At first, I was investing small amounts (often $1k or up to $5k) on AngelList via SPVs. My first larger personal investments were in Protocol Labs and Haystack’s first fund.</p>

<p>
While at Carta, I didn’t have time to invest. After leaving, I’ve been selectively investing in early stage startups, funds, and crypto projects.</p>
