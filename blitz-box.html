<h2>The Game</h2>

<p>Blitz Box is a modern take on <strong>Shut the Box</strong>, an ancient dice game that's been played in pubs, on ships, and across kitchen tables for centuries. The rules are simple: roll the dice, close tiles that match the total, and try to shut every tile on the board. But simple rules don't mean simple decisions.</p>

<p>We discovered the original game at a Goodwill store for $4 and couldn't stop playing. So we built something new — bold, fast, and packed with more ways to play.</p>

<h2>Three Worlds, One Box</h2>

<p>Each game mode lives in its own visual world with distinct rules, aesthetics, and level of complexity.</p>

    <p>The original game. One row of tiles numbered 1-9. Roll two dice, close any combination matching the total. When only tiles 6 and under remain, switch to one die. Pure and timeless.</p>

<h2>The Cards</h2>

<p>In Triple Stack mode, cards change everything. Nine powerups you can play from your hand, and nine bad surprises that trigger when you least expect them.</p>

<h3>Powerups</h3>

<p>Play these anytime from your hand to turn the tide.</p>

<h2>The History</h2>

<p>Shut the Box has been played for over a century. The earliest written record dates to <strong>1893 in France</strong>, where it was known as <em>Jeu du Trac</em>. It spread sailor-to-sailor across ports and coastlines, became a staple in British pubs by the 1950s, and even appeared on NBC's <em>High Rollers</em> game show in 1974.</p>

<p>There's something about the game that just works — simple enough to explain to anyone, tense enough to make every roll matter. Blitz Box takes that foundation and builds on it with blocking mechanics, a card economy, and three distinct visual worlds.</p>

<h2>Made in Sonoma County</h2>

<p>Blitz Box is made by a family in Sonoma County, California. No ads, ever.</p>
